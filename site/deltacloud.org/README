Getting the sources
-------------------

Then Deltacloud Core gives you the API and drivers to various cloud providers.
It also provides a client library and a commandline interface.

The Deltacloud Core repository is hosted on Apache Incubator.
Apache uses Subversion, but there is a git mirror available:

    $ mkdir deltacloud
    $ cd deltacloud
    $ git clone git://git.apache.org/deltacloud.git core

You can find the Subversion repository at: <https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/deltacloud>.

Required packages
-----------------
In order to make the Deltacloud components work, you'll need to
have the following packages installed (on Fedora 12; the names may vary on
your distro):

    ruby
    ruby-devel
    gcc-c++
    libxml2-devel
    libxslt-devel

**Note:** these packages are necessary for building all the required ruby gems
that Deltacloud requires. If you want to install the gems using your system's
package manager (yum, apt, ports, etc.) you won't need to install these
packages manually.

Installing the Deltacloud Core
------------------------------

First, you need to install the server that will give you the Deltacloud API:

    $ cd path/to/deltacloud/core/server
    $ rake package
    $ sudo gem install pkg/deltacloud-core-<version>.gem

Then install the client library:

    $ cd path/to/deltacloud/core/client
    $ rake package
    $ sudo gem install pkg/deltacloud-client-<version>.gem

Once you have the client installed, run the following command:

    $ cd path/to/deltacloud/core/client
    $ rake fixtures
